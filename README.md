## Inspiration

A study, led by Prashant Loyalka of Stanford University, analyzed that the 65,000 CS graduates from the United States are outnumbered, but are much more skilled, on average, than the same graduates from China (185,000), India (215,000), and Russia (17,000). The results were published recently in a publication of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
